## üìå Installation Guide

<details><summary>Installation</summary>

## **Prerequisites**
Before installing Lumen, make sure your server meets the following requirements:

- **Minecraft Server:** PaperMC **1.21 or higher** (recommended **1.21.4**, the latest stable version).
- **Java:** Version **21 or higher**.
- **Optional Dependencies:**
    - **CoreProtect (Optional):** Enables tracking and rollback of placed or removed lights. Integration can be verified in the console upon server startup.
    - **FastAsyncWorldEdit (Optional):** Optimizes performance for placing and removing large amounts of lights.

---

## **Step 1: Download the Plugin**
Download the latest version of **Lumen** from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lumen) and ensure you obtain a valid `.jar` file.

---

## **Step 2: Installation**
1. **Upload the file** `Lumen.jar` to the `plugins/` folder of your PaperMC server.
2. **Restart the server** to automatically generate the configuration files.
3. **Verify installation** by checking the console. If the installation was successful, you will see a message indicating that the plugin has been loaded correctly.

---

## **Step 3: Initial Configuration**
1. **Navigate to the configuration folder:** `plugins/Lumen/`
2. **Edit `config.yml`** to adjust performance settings, such as:
    - `command_lights_per_tick`: Number of lights added per tick when using commands.
    - `torch_lights_per_tick`: Number of lights added per tick when using torches.
    - `torch_tick_interval`: Interval between torch ticks.
    - `mob_torch_radius`: Protection radius of the anti-mob torch.
3. **If using CoreProtect,** check the server console on startup. If integration is successful, you will see a message indicating that CoreProtect has been detected and is active in Lumen.
4. **If using FastAsyncWorldEdit,** ensure it is installed and properly configured to optimize the placement and removal of lights.

---

## **Step 4: Troubleshooting**
- **The plugin does not load:** It is recommended to use **PaperMC 1.21.4**, the latest stable version. Also, ensure you are using Java 21 or higher.
- **CoreProtect errors:** Check the console when starting the server. If integration does not activate, ensure CoreProtect is correctly installed.
- **Low performance when placing lights:** Adjust values in `config.yml` and/or install **FastAsyncWorldEdit** to optimize large-scale block processing.
- Only newly placed `Lumen Torch` and `Lumen Guard` will have effects of changes in config.yml. Previously placed torches will not be affected unless removed and placed again.
